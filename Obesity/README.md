# A STUDY ON OBESITY BASED ON HABITS AND PHYSICAL CONDITION

As per the World Health Organisation (WHO), the worldwide prevalence of obesity
nearly tripled between 1975 and 2016. Obesity, once considered a problem in wealthy
nations, is shifting in low and middle-income countries. According to the Global
Burden of Disease (GBD) study, 5.02 million people died prematurely in 2019 due
to obesity, nearly six times the number that died from HIV/AIDS that year.

Obesity is on the rise in India, with one out of every four people being overweight.
The prevalence of obesity among Indians increased in 2019-21 compared to 2015-16,
as per the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) data.
